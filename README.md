# Hi this is Micheal Callahan and this is the repository for all of my adventofcode projects
# For these projects I experiment and retain my knowledge of multiple programming languages by challenging myself
# Advent of code is a new code challenge released each day in December and can be found at this website here https://adventofcode.com/
# If you have any questions at all feel free to contact me at micheal.callahan@icloud.com
