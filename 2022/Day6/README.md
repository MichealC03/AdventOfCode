# This program is looking for 4 distinct chars in part 1 and 14 in part 2
# I first change this string to a charArray to make looking at elements easier
# I then use a for loop to look through and see if there is a match between any chars
# If there isnt than I know I found a unique case and that I can then print out how many chars it took to get there
